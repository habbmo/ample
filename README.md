## Setting expectations
- No more features are being added, in order to focus on the next generation of Ampache ðŸ’ª
- Largely untested with multiple users
- Transcoding is untested as I don't use it
- It is designed to be a front-end companion to an existing Ampache server, not a complete replacement

## Requirements
- [Ampache](https://ampache.org/) 6+
- A modern web browser (Chrome/Edge 88+, Firefox 78+, Safari 14+)

## Installing
- Easy mode (recommended)
  - Grab a prebuilt [release](https://github.com/mitchray/ample/releases)
  - Copy the ```ample``` folder into your Ampache server ```public``` folder
  - Access by adding ```/ample``` to your Ampache server address e.g. ```yourampache.com/ample``` or ```localhost/ampache/ample```
- Hard mode
  - Grab a prebuilt [release](https://github.com/mitchray/ample/releases) or build yourself from Git repository (see Developing)
  - Put it anywhere you like, but you will have to deal with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSMissingAllowOrigin) if it is on a different domain/subdomain from the Ampache server you are connecting to.
- Enter the URL of the Ampache server you wish to connect to on the login screen 
  - Alternatively add the URL to ```ample.json``` to hardcode it (rename ```ample.json.dist``` & use the full URL with no trailing slash i.e. ```https://yourampache.com```)

## Developing
- Clone the Ample repository and from the ample directory ```cd ample```
- Install packages ```npm install```
- For development and hot reloading ```npm run dev```
- For building ```npm run build```, and see the contents of ```dist```

Additional console logging can be enabled by setting ```debugMode true``` in ```src/stores/server.js```
